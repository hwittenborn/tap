<h1 align="center">Tap</h2>

## Overview
Tap is a second-generation MPR helper written in Python, being the successor to [mpm](https://github.com/hwittenborn/mpm). It provides numerous benefits over mpm, including a plethora of more features, and an overall smoother and snappier experience.

Tap currently contains the following features:

- Installing
- Updating
- Searching
- Listing locally installed packages from the MPR
- Installing dependencies from the MPR (not yet in the deployed release)

There is also a roadmap [here](https://github.com/hwittenborn/tap/issues/7) that is tracking the development to a 1.0.0 release, which somewhat outlines Tap's current major features.

Tap is currently in beta, and is also in very rapid development. Likewise, bugs are almost guaranteed to crop up somewhere, and you should avoid Tap for the time being if you're expecting a smooth experience 100% of the time.

## Installation and usage
Tap can be installed [directly from the MPR](https://dur.hunterwittenborn.com/packages/tap).

Help with available commands can be found after installation with `tap --help`.
